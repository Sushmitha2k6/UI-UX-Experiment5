# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To design and analyze a multi-screen UX layout for an E-Commerce UX Research Platform, including major screens such as the Welcome Page, Login Page, Dashboard, Scenarios Page, and Personas Page. The objective is to understand navigation flow and structure for a user-centric research tool.
## Algorithm:
1.Identify the main platform purpose
– A UX Research Platform for studying e-commerce scenarios and personas.

2.Define the essential screens/pages required:

Welcome/Splash Screen

Login/Signup Screen

Home/Dashboard

Research Scenarios Page

Personas Page or Final Action Page

3.Analyze the user journey and outline how users enter the system (Sign In/Sign Up) and access features.

4.Sketch the wireframes of each page using UX principles—layout, hierarchy, navigation, and call-to-action buttons.

5.Use a tool (e.g., Balsamiq, Figma, Sketch) to create visually clear wireframes representing each screen's structure.

6.Ensure consistency in spacing, typography, colors, and button placement across all screens.

7.Validate the layout by checking usability factors such as:
– easy navigation
– visible CTAs
– intuitive form fields
– clear headings
